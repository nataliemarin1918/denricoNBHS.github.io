      <p>“About all you can do in life is be who you are. Some people will love you for you. Most will love you for what you can do for them, and some won't like you at all.” -RITA MAE BROWN</p>

I just love this quote because it's bascially telling you there are obviously going to be people who use you, dislike you, or have no respect for you. Don't waste your time trying to please everyone... just be yourself.</p>

       <p>So it's Halloween! Today, I dressed to school as Mia Wallace from Pulp Fiction. An hour or two into the school day it got really hot and so I changed. I went trick or treating with my friends and I got a LOT of candy! I had a lot of fun. I can't believe October has come to an end...</p>
